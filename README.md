### Masha Aseeva ðŸ‘‹
#### Hi, I'm Masha (she/her) - a genomics software engineer currently at Myriad Genetics. I'm passionate about the intersection of biology and computer science, as well as making that space inclusive to all sorts of people. I'm based in the East Bay Area in California and enjoy reading, writing, concerts, and bouldering (pre-COVID.) 

#### ðŸ”­  Iâ€™ve previously worked on ...
